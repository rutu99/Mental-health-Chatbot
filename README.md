# Mental-health-Chatbot
This project is a Mental Health Chatbot designed to provide mental wellness support and stress management advice to users. The chatbot leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning models to understand user inputs and offer appropriate mental health guidance. While it does not replace professional help just provides a safe space.
